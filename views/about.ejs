Persons coming to take a test need to have an I.D. and the $10.00 exam fee. Anyone for upgrade would also need to bring a copy of their existing license.

The party will be held at St. Andrew’s Church Parish Hall, located at 400 W. Broadway in Maryville. As in the past, members planning on attending are to bring some type of dish of food to share.

The subject of John’s presentation is DMR (Digital Mobile Radio) Before the program, a short break was taken for coffee and cookies.

In the DMR, he used his slides to show the various features of DMR and how the system is integrated to use digital repeaters linked to the internet to provide reliable communications over long distances.

                                                    <div>and told him that he (Jim) had lost the club license. Mac re-applied for a new license, explaining to the FCC on</div>
